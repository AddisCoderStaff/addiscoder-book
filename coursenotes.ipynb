The language we will learn here at AddisCoder is called \"Python\". **Python** is a popular **programming language** used around the world by many people. You can write Python code to create almost anything you want, including online shopping websites, video games, medical data analysis tools, and more!\n",

Instructions to the computer must be specific and must follow the rules of our language (which is Python in our case). **Types** are the different categories of values that the computer understands. Each **type** has its own characteristics and interacts with other **types** according to specific rules. For example, we saw earlier that we could not add an integer variable with a string variable.\n",

Many recursive solutions to a problem end up with few lines of code and some consider them more elegant. However, recursive method, without proper optimization, can run into situations in which the number of recursive function calls with smaller inputs might require too much power from your computer! When approaching a particular problem, consider the trade-offs of different methods before committing to one method."
